# Deliverable
- Post a GitHub Page installation instructions
- Steps followed, commands issued and explained, and links used toinstall the application
- Screenshots of the running application (as described earlier)
- Your installation instructions should stand alone
- Readers can follow just from your GitHub Page without having to visit other linksto complete the installation and testing (unlike the installation instructionsprovided in this presentation)
